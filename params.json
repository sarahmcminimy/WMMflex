It will host data and analysis from significant landscape studies, which will be displayed visually on an interactive world map. This map will serve as the centre of the platform, and will help the user explore data in a way that is informative without being overwhelming. The map will incorporate interactive data tools, such as customizable graphs and tables to compare data. Periodic posts on relevant issues and best/innovative practices in microinsurance will be released on this platform.  The site will also contain country and region profiles, as well as open discussion forums.\r\n\r\n \r\nWhy do we need it?\r\n\r\nAs microinsurance is an emerging industry, there is not sufficient data to create field-wide benchmarks on which to assess performance. Data is critical to the advancement of microinsurance, as it generates market knowledge, facilitates market development, furthers best practices and can lead to better products and services. On a global level, data can identify factors that detract from or drive development. Country-level data is essential to effective pricing, insurers’ ability to understand the low-income market, and the development of quantitative goals and benchmarks. On a company-level basis, improving insurers’ knowledge of the low-income market is mutually beneficial for both the insurer and the client: Clients gain access to products which better meet their needs, and insurers can expand their client base.  Insurance is a data-driven industry, and the World Map of Microinsurance will enable the sector to develop effectively, producing more valuable products for clients while improving profitability for insurers.\r\n\r\n \r\nWhat will it achieve?\r\n\r\nUltimately, we want the WMM to advance microinsurance as a tool that can effectively protect low income populations in developing countries against the crises that push them into and trap them in poverty.\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved, first and foremost, by providing insurers with the knowledge they need to create more valuable and effective products. By gaining a better understanding of the low income market and the specific needs of the clients they serve, firms can design products which meet the needs of their client-base at a price that is efficient. The tractability of the data will allow firms to gain important information about the market they work in, and subsequently will empower them to grow their business, reaching even more low-income clients.\r\n\r\nThe platform will be the destination for data and research on microinsurance. Having data on microinsurance converge in one location creates a space for further knowledge generation, collaboration, and learning.  Creating a collective authority on microinsurance will help gain respect and recognition for the industry, and will advance its status as an important tool for development worldwide.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
